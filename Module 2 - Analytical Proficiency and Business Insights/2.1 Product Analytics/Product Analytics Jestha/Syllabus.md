# Product Analytics for Data Scientists

## Key Concepts in Product Analytics
1. **Metrics and KPIs**: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and essential metrics for tracking product performance.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding how users interact with the product.
3. **A/B Testing**: Experimenting with different variations to determine what works best.
4. **Funnel Analysis**: Analyzing the steps users take to complete a goal.
5. **Cohort Analysis**: Grouping users based on shared characteristics to analyze behavior over time.
6. **Retention Analysis**: Measuring how many users continue to use the product over a period.
7. **Churn Analysis**: Understanding why users stop using the product.

## Data Collection and Management
1. **Event Tracking**: Collecting data on specific user actions within the product.
2. **User Segmentation**: Categorizing users based on behavior, demographics, or other criteria.
3. **Data Warehousing**: Storing and managing large volumes of data.
4. **ETL Processes**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data for analysis.

## Analytical Techniques
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizing historical data to understand what has happened.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics**: Identifying the causes of observed behaviors and trends.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Using statistical models and machine learning to forecast future behavior.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommending actions based on predictive insights.

## Visualization and Reporting
1. **Dashboards**: Creating real-time visual displays of key metrics and KPIs.
2. **Reports**: Generating periodic summaries of product performance.
3. **Data Storytelling**: Presenting insights in a compelling and understandable way.

## Tools and Platforms
1. **Analytics Tools**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude.
2. **Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, Looker.
3. **Data Management Tools**: SQL, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.

## User Journey and Experience
1. **Customer Journey Mapping**: Visualizing the end-to-end user experience.
2. **User Feedback Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing user feedback and reviews.
3. **Session Replay and Heatmaps**: Observing user interactions to identify pain points and opportunities.

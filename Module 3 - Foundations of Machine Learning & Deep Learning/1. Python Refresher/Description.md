## Python Refresher Assignments

1. **Basic Syntax and Data Types:**
   - Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - String manipulation (concatenation, slicing, formatting)
   - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
   - Basic operations on data structures (accessing elements, appending, removing)

2. **Control Flow:**
   - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
   - Loops (for loops, while loops)
   - Control flow statements (break, continue)
   - List comprehensions

3. **Functions:**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Function arguments and return values
   - Scope of variables (global vs local)
   - Lambda functions

4. **Advanced Data Structures:**
   - Sets and their operations
   - More advanced dictionary operations (nested dictionaries, dictionary comprehensions)
   - Working with multi-dimensional lists (matrices)

5. **File Handling:**
   - Reading from and writing to files
   - Using context managers (with statement)
   - File modes (read, write, append)

6. **Exception Handling:**
   - Handling errors and exceptions using try-except blocks
   - Handling specific exceptions
   - Using finally block

7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Classes and objects
   - Attributes and methods
   - Inheritance and method overriding
   - Encapsulation and abstraction

8. **Modules and Packages:**
   - Creating and using modules
   - Importing modules and packages
   - Exploring the Python Standard Library

9. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Writing test cases using `unittest` or `pytest`
   - Debugging techniques (using print statements, debugging tools)
   - Handling errors gracefully

10. **Advanced Topics (Optional):**
    - Decorators
    - Generators and iterators
    - Regular expressions
    - Concurrency and parallelism (using threads or multiprocessing)

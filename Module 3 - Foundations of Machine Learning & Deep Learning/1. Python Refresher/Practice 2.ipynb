    "# File handling is an important part of any web application.\n",
    "# Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.\n",
    "# The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.\n",
    "# The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.\n",
    "# There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:\n",
    "# \"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "# \"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "# \"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "# \"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n",
    "# In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode\n",
    "# \"t\" - Text - Default value. Text mode\n",
    "# \"b\" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)\n",
    "# To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file.\n",
    "# To open the file, use the built-in open() function.\n",
    "# The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file.\n",
    "# The file can be closed using the close() method.\n",
    "# It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.\n",

    "# This way, you don't have to close the file when you are done with it.\n",

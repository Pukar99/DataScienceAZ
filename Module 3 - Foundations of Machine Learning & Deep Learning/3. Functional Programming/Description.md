    - Applying lambda functions for simple data transformations
    - Using lambda functions with built-in functions like map, filter, and reduce

3. **Map, Filter, and Reduce:**
    - Using the map function to apply a function to each element of an iterable
    - Filtering elements from an iterable using the filter function
    - Reducing an iterable to a single value using the reduce function

4. **List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions:**
    - Writing list comprehensions for concise and readable code
    - Understanding the syntax and advantages of generator expressions
    - Comparing list comprehensions and generator expressions in terms of memory usage and performance

5. **Recursion:**

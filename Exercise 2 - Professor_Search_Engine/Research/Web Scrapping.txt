What is Web Scraping?
-   Web scraping involves fetching web pages and extracting specific data from them in a structured format like CSV or JSON.
    It automates the process of manually copying data from websites, making it efficient to extract large amounts of data.
    Common use cases include price monitoring, market research, lead generation, content monitoring, and data mining.
How Does Web Scraping Work?
 -   Web scrapers send HTTP requests to websites and retrieve the HTML content of web pages.
    They then parse the HTML using techniques like regular expressions or HTML parsing libraries to extract the desired data.
    Some websites try to detect and block web scrapers using measures like IP blocking or CAPTCHA challenges.
Web Scraping Tools and Libraries
 -   Python has powerful libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium for web scraping.
    These libraries provide functionality for sending requests, parsing HTML/XML, handling JavaScript, and more.
    There are also dedicated web scraping tools and services that can be used instead of coding scrapers from scratch.

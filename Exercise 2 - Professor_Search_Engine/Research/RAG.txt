What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
    RAG is a framework that allows LLMs to access and utilize information from external databases or knowledge sources when generating responses.
    It combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external sources in a two-step process:
        Retrieval: Relevant information is retrieved from external databases based on the input query or prompt.
        Generation: The retrieved information is provided as additional context to the LLM, which then generates a response by combining its own knowledge with the retrieved information.

Benefits of RAG
    Improves the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses by grounding them in factual information from external sources.
    Allows LLMs to incorporate up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge, reducing hallucinations and outdated information.
    Provides transparency by allowing users to verify the sources used by the LLM in generating its response.
    Reduces the need for continuous retraining or fine-tuning of LLMs as new information becomes available, as the external sources can be updated independently.

Applications of RAG
    Question answering systems that require access to specific knowledge bases or databases.
    Chatbots and virtual assistants that need to provide accurate and up-to-date information from various sources.
    Document summarization and analysis tasks that require integrating information from multiple sources.
    Knowledge-intensive applications in domains like healthcare, finance, and legal, where access to reliable and current information is crucial.

Question Answering Models(Q&A)
-   Question Answering (Q&A) models fine-tuned with Large Language Models (LLMs) on custom datasets are a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of 
    language models in specific domains or applications. These models are trained on large datasets of text and are designed to generate human-like 
    responses to user queries. Fine-tuning LLMs on custom datasets involves adapting the pre-trained model to a specific domain or task by training it on  
    a dataset relevant to that domain. This process allows the model to learn domain-specific knowledge and improve its performance in answering questions
    related to that domain.
The process of fine-tuning LLMs for Q&A typically involves several steps:
    Data Collection: Gathering a dataset of questions and answers relevant to the specific domain or task. 
        This dataset should be large enough to provide the model with a good understanding of the domain and the types of questions that can be asked.
    Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data to prepare it for the model. This can include tokenization, normalization, and possibly even additional 
        processing steps depending on the specific requirements of the model.
    Model Selection: Choosing a suitable pre-trained LLM model that is compatible with the dataset and the task at hand. This can be a model like BERT, 
        RoBERTa, or others that have been pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
    Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning the selected model on the custom dataset. This involves adjusting the model's parameters to better fit the specific domain 
        or task by minimizing the difference between the model's predictions and the actual answers in the dataset.
    Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned model on a test set to ensure it is performing well and making accurate predictions.

What is LlamaIndex?
    LlamaIndex is an open-source Python library that acts as a bridge between your private/custom data and LLMs.
    It provides tools to ingest various data formats (PDFs, documents, databases, APIs, etc.), structure the data, and allow LLMs to query and reason over this data.
    The goal is to augment the knowledge of LLMs with your specific data to build powerful AI applications.
    
How Does LlamaIndex Work?
    Data Ingestion: LlamaIndex has over 100 data loaders to connect to different data sources like files, databases, web APIs, etc.
    Data Indexing: It structures and indexes the ingested data using different indexing strategies like list, tree, vector, etc. based on the data characteristics.
    Data Querying: LlamaIndex provides an interface to query the indexed data using natural language prompts. It retrieves relevant data chunks and passes them to the LLM for generating a response.
    LLM Integration: LlamaIndex supports integration with various LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. and allows chaining multiple LLMs.

Key Features:
    Supports over 160 data sources and 40 vector databases
    Provides different indexing strategies optimized for different data structures
    Allows combining data from multiple sources for querying
    Offers tools for evaluating LLM response quality and retrieval performance
    Has an active open-source community with contributions and integrations

In essence, LlamaIndex simplifies the process of integrating custom data with LLMs, enabling developers to build data-aware AI applications more efficiently.

## Excel and Google Spreadsheets

### Task 1: Introduction to Excel and Formulas
- **Objective:** Gain familiarity with Excel and basic formula usage for data manipulation.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Open Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
  2. Create a new workbook or spreadsheet.
  3. Import the provided sample dataset (e.g., sales data, student grades).
  4. Use formulas (e.g., `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`) to calculate total, average, maximum, and minimum values based on the dataset.
  5. Apply conditional formatting to highlight cells meeting specific criteria (e.g., sales > $1000).
- **Example Output:** Screenshots of the spreadsheet with formulas and conditional formatting applied, accompanied by a brief explanation of each formula used.
- **Deadline:** This week

### Task 2: Pivot Tables, Charts, and Statistical Functions
- **Objective:** Understand pivot tables, create charts, and utilize statistical functions.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a pivot table to summarize the dataset by different dimensions (e.g., region, product category).
  2. Generate various charts and graphs (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart) to visually represent data trends and patterns.
  3. Utilize statistical functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `STDEV`) to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
- **Example Output:** Screenshots of the pivot table, charts, and statistical analysis, accompanied by explanations of key findings.
- **Deadline:** This week

### Task 3: Google Spreadsheets
- **Objective:** Familiarize with Google Spreadsheets and compare functionalities with Excel.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Repeat Task 1 and Task 2 using Google Spreadsheets instead of Excel.
  2. Explore collaborative features such as sharing the spreadsheet with others and simultaneous editing.
- **Example Output:** Screenshots comparing Excel and Google Spreadsheets functionalities, accompanied by a brief summary of observations.
- **Deadline:** This week

## Beginner Python

### Task 1: Flowcharts, Data Types, Operations
- **Objective:** Understand basic Python concepts and perform arithmetic operations.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a flowchart illustrating a simple process (e.g., calculating the area of a rectangle).
  2. Define different data types (integers, floats, strings) and perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- **Example Output:** Image of the flowchart and Python code demonstrating arithmetic operations.
- **Deadline:** This week

### Task 2: Conditional Statements & Loops
- **Objective:** Implement conditional statements and loops in Python.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Write Python code using if-else statements to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.
  2. Use loops (for loop, while loop) to iterate over sequences and perform repetitive tasks.
- **Example Output:** Python code demonstrating conditional statements and loops, along with comments explaining the logic.
- **Deadline:** This week

### Task 3: Functions
- **Objective:** Define and call functions in Python.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
  2. Call functions with arguments and return values to perform specific tasks.
- **Example Output:** Python code with defined functions, accompanied by examples of function calls and outputs.
- **Deadline:** This week

### Task 4: Strings
- **Objective:** Manipulate strings in Python.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Perform string operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
  2. Experiment with different string methods to modify and manipulate strings effectively.
- **Example Output:** Python code demonstrating string manipulation techniques, along with explanations of each operation.
- **Deadline:** This week

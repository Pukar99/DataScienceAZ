    "# Function and Recursion - 3 questions\n",
    "# Function: Write a function that takes two lists of integers and returns a list containing the elements that appear in both lists. Do not use any built-in set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function: Write a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary with the counts of each vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in the string. The function should be case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursion: Write a recursive function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DSA - 1 question\n",
    "# DSA: Write a function that takes a list of integers and sorts them using the merge sort algorithm. Do not use any built-in sorting functions.\n",
    "# OOP - 1 question\n",
    "# OOP: Create a 'BankAccount' class with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. Ensure that the balance cannot go negative and throw an exception if a withdrawal is attempted with insufficient funds. Include a method to transfer money between two BankAccount instances.\n",
    "# Pandas+Numpy Combined - 1 question\n",
    "# Pandas+Numpy: Using a given DataFrame, normalize each column (i.e., rescale the values to be between 0 and 1). Return a DataFrame containing only the columns where the maximum value before normalization was greater than 50.\n",

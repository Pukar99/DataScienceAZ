1. **Which SQL statement is used to insert new data into the database?**
   The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new data into a database.

2. **What does the term SQL injection refer to?**
   SQL injection refers to a security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates a SQL query by inserting or altering SQL code through the data input from the client to the application.

3. **What is the purpose of the SQL LIKE operator?**
   The SQL LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.

4. **In SQL, what is the purpose of the rollback statement?**
   The ROLLBACK statement in SQL is used to undo transactions that have not yet been saved to the database.

5. **Which SQL function is used to convert a value to uppercase?**
   The `UPPER()` function is used to convert a string to uppercase.

6. **What is the primary advantage of using word embedding such as Word2Vec or GloVe over traditional bag-of-words representations for text data?**
   The primary advantage is that word embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, unlike bag-of-words which merely counts word frequencies and ignores context.

7. **Which AI technique involves mimicking the structure and function of the human brain to build intelligent systems?**
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) involve mimicking the structure and function of the human brain.

8. **What is the role of reinforcement learning in AI?**
   Reinforcement learning is used in AI to make sequences of decisions by learning policies that maximize a cumulative reward.

9. **Which technique is used for transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new task with a different dataset?**
   Transfer learning is the technique used to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new task.

10. **Which method is used for reducing the dimensionality of text data while preserving semantic meaning?**
    Techniques like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or word embeddings are used for this purpose.

11. **Which of the following is not a supervised learning algorithm? Decision tree, k-means clustering, support vector machines, linear regression**
    K-means clustering is not a supervised learning algorithm; it's a clustering (unsupervised learning) technique.

12. **What is the primary purpose of backpropagation in neural networks?**
    The primary purpose of backpropagation is to update the weights of a neural network efficiently to minimize the difference between the actual output and the desired output.

13. **In calculus, what does the derivative of a function represent geometrically?**
    Geometrically, the derivative of a function at a point represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point.

14. **Which of the following is a characteristic of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?**
    CNNs are characterized by their use of convolutional layers, which automatically detect and learn spatial hierarchies in data such as images.

15. **Which rule is used to find the derivative of a product of two functions? Chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, power rule**
    The product rule is used to find the derivative of the product of two functions.

16. **What is the derivative of the function f(x) = e^x?**
    The derivative of f(x) = e^x is f'(x) = e^x.

17. **What is the primary characteristic of supervised learning?**
    The primary characteristic of supervised learning is the use of labeled datasets to train models that can predict the output associated with new inputs.

18. **What are the two main types of supervised learning tasks?**
    The two main types are classification and regression.

19. **Which of the following is an example of a regression problem in supervised learning?**
    Predicting house prices based on its features is an example of a regression problem.

20. **What is the primary goal of unsupervised learning?**
    The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to identify patterns or structures in data without the use of labels or with minimal human supervision.

What is Generative AI?
- Generative AI refers to a type of AI that generates new data resembling given training datasets.
- It learns the underlying patterns and structure of the data using neural networks to generate new and original content.

Applications of Generative AI:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): chatbots, translation, text generation
- Content Generation (writing blogs, news)
- Image and Video Generation
- Data Generation and Analysis (Data Science and Analytics)
- Healthcare (simulation and diagnosis)
- Finance (fraud detection)

How does Generative AI work?
- Generative AI models use deep learning to analyze common patterns and arrangements in large sets of data.
- They then use this information to create new, convincing outputs.
- These models incorporate machine learning techniques known as neural networks.
- Process:
  Data collection -> Training -> Generation -> Fine-tuning

What are Large Language Models?
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use deep learning algorithms to process and understand natural language.
- These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language.
- They can understand complex textual data, identify entities and relationships between them, and generate new text that is coherent and grammatically accurate.

What are the differences between Generative AI and Discriminative AI?
- Generative AI refers to deep learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on.
- Discriminative AI refers to a class of models used in statistical classification, mainly for supervised machine learning. These types of models are also known as conditional models since they learn the boundaries between classes or labels in a dataset.

What are the different types of Generative AI?
Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages machine learning techniques to generate data. The most common types of Generative AI include:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): These are generative algorithms that use deep learning techniques to produce complex models, which are then used to generate data.

Transformer Models: These are models that use self-attention mechanisms and are often used for natural language processing tasks, including text generation.

Autoregressive Models: These models predict future data points based on previously observed data.

What is Generative AI ?
- Generative AI refers to a type of AI that generates new data that resemble a gives training datasets.
- It learns that underlying patterns and structure of the data witht he help of neural networks to generate new and original content 

Application of Generative AI:
-  Natural Language Process (NLP): chatbot, translation, text-generation
- Content Generation (Writing blogs, news )
- Image and Video Generation
- Data Generation and Anlaysis(Data Science and Analytics)
- Healthcare (Simulate & Diaganose)
- Finance (Fraud Detection)


How does Generative AI works?
- Generative AI models use deep learning to analyze common patterns and arrangements in large set of data.
- Then they use this information to create new, convincing outputs.
- The modles do this by incorporating machine learning techniques known as neural networks
- Process:
  Data collection ----> Training  ----> Generation ----> Fine tuning 


What are Large Language Models?
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use deep learning alogrithms to process and understand natural language.
- These modles are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language.
- They can understand complex textual data, identify entitites and realtionships between them, and generate new text that is coherent and grammatically accurate.


What is the differences between Generative AI and Discriminative AI?
- Generative AI refers to deep- learning model sthat can generate high-quality text, images and other content based on the data they were trained on.
- Discriminative AI referes to a class of models used in statistical classification, mainly used for supervised machine learning. These types of modles are 
also known as conditional models since they learn the boundaries between classes or labels in a dataset.
